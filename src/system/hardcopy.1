     [EACCES]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the directory in
                        which it is to be created does not permit writing.

     [EACCES]           O_TRUNC is specified and write permission is denied.

     [EAGAIN]           path specifies the slave side of a locked pseudo-terminal device.

     [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the directory in
                        which the entry for the new file is being placed cannot be extended
                        because the user's quota of disk blocks on the file system containing
                        the directory has been exhausted.

     [EDQUOT]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the user's quota of
                        inodes on the file system on which the file is being created has been
                        exhausted.

     [EEXIST]           O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified and the file exists.

     [EFAULT]           Path points outside the process's allocated address space.

     [EINTR]            The open() operation is interrupted by a signal.

     [EINVAL]           The value of oflag is not valid.

     [EIO]              An I/O error occurs while making the directory entry or allocating the
                        inode for O_CREAT.

     [EISDIR]           The named file is a directory, and the arguments specify that it is to
                        be opened for writing.

     [ELOOP]            Too many symbolic links are encountered in translating the pathname.
                        This is taken to be indicative of a looping symbolic link.

     [EMFILE]           The process has already reached its limit for open file descriptors.

     [ENAMETOOLONG]     A component of a pathname exceeds {NAME_MAX} characters, or an entire
                        path name exceeded {PATH_MAX} characters.

     [ENFILE]           The system file table is full.

     [ELOOP]            O_NOFOLLOW was specified and the target is a symbolic link.

     [ENOENT]           O_CREAT is not set and the named file does not exist.

     [ENOENT]           A component of the path name that must exist does not exist.

     [ENOSPC]           O_CREAT is specified, the file does not exist, and the directory in
                        which the entry for the new file is being placed cannot be extended
                        because there is no space left on the file system containing the direc-
                        tory.
